# Restful-Api-using-python
In this i had built a restful api using the framewrok flask in pytho.
I had use VsStudio for this.
For this first you need to make sure you had install flask on your terminal
For the database connection i had used mysqlworkbench in this.
for the crud operations you have to use postman tool, which is very easy to use, you just have to simply run the code on the terminal and once the server is running, you can test the API using tools like curl, Postman, or directly from the browser.
